Good Day,
 
Let me start by apologizing the manner at which i approached you without prior communication. I am Patrick Chan, the director of operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd Hong Kong.
 
I will need you to assist me in executing a business project worth ten million five hundred thousand US dollars (10,500,000.00 USD) that involves transfering the said fund from my country to your country. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account, we shall then share it in the ratio of 60% for me, 40% for you.

Should you be interested in this project, please kindly reply me in my private email: patrick.chan053@yahoo.com.hk, so that i can give you more details about the business transaction.

regards,
Patrick Chan
patrick.chan053@yahoo.com.hk
