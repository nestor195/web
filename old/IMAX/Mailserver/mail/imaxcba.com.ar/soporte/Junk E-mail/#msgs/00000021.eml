Mr Danbaba Rawaa
bill and exchange manager, 
Bank of Africa Annex 
Ouagadougou, bf 



First i must solicit for your confidence in this transaction; this is by=
 virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential. Though i know that a=
 transaction of this magnitude will make anyone apprehensive and worried but=
 i am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the deal. I have=
 decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction, let me start=
 by introducing myself properly to you.  i am Mr.Danbaba Rawaa, the bill and=
 exchange manager of the bank of Africa annex  here in Ouagadougou , Burkina=
 Faso . I came to know you in my private search through the internet for a=
 reliable and reputable person to handle this confidential transaction,=
 which involves the transfer of huge sum of money to a foreign country=
 requiring maximum confidence i feel quite safe dealing with you in this=
 important business though, this medium (internet) has been greatly abused,=
 i choose to reach you through it because it still remains the fastest=
 medium of communication. However, this correspondence is unofficial and=
 private, and it should be treated as such. 

  

The proposition: 


a foreigner who met his death in =91Thailand plane crash banked with us at the=
 bank of Africa annex here in Burkina Faso and had a closing balance as at=
 the end of September 2007 worth $18,200.000.00 (eighteen million two=
 hundred thousand united states dollars).after going into deeply=
 investigation i found out that Hessian died on Sunday 164th September 2007=
 in a plane crash. 

  

For more details visit:=
 http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/6997381.stm 

  

The bank now expects a next of kin as beneficiary and valuable efforts have=
 been made by bank of Africa to get in touch with any of Hessian=92s family or=
 relatives but to no success.  It is because of the perceived possibility of=
 not being able to locate any of the late depositor=92s next-of-kin (he had no=
 wife or children that is known to us). based upon this discovery, I have=
 decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you=
 as next-of-kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent=
 disbursement since nobody is coming for it and i don't want this money to=
 go into the country treasury as unclaimed funds that is why i contact you=
 because of the law imposed by the British prime minister Gordon brown said=
 in world press conference on Tuesday 6 December 2005, at 12:18 GMT:- 

  

For more information about the prime minister decision on dormant accounts=
 visit:  http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4017381.stm 

  

If such money remained unclaimed after three years, the money will be=
 transferred into the country treasury as unclaimed funds. The request for a=
 foreigner as next-of-kin is occasioned by the fact that, the late depositor=
 was a foreigner and so an indigene cannot stand as the next-of-kin. in=
 order to avert this development, I now seek your permission to have you=
 stand as next of kin to the late depositor so that the fund, us $18.2=
 million will be released and paid to you as the beneficiary next-of-kin.=
 all documents and proves to enable you get this fund will be carefully=
 worked out on your acceptance to partake in this transaction in my=
 department i have secured from probate an order of mandamus to locate any=
 of the declared beneficiary (next of kin) and more so i am assuring you=
 that this business is 100% risk free. meanwhile your percentage share shall=
 be 40% with respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10% has been set=
 aside for any expenses we might occur while the remaining 50% will be for=
 me as soon as i acknowledge receipt of your acceptance of this business=
 proposal, i would furnish you with the necessary steps to take beginning=
 with the text of application which you shall forward to the bank for=
 scrutiny and approval. Please if this is acceptable by you, do not make=
 undue of the trust i have bestowed in you.
Best regards,  

 
Mr Danbaba Rawaa

Bill and Exchange Manager, 
Bank of Africa Annex
