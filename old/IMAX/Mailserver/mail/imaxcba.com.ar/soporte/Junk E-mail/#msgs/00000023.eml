From Hilda Gabz/Dearest One

Dearest One,

Best compliments of the season.I will like you to read this mail carefully =
for you to be able to understand the details of my mail and the reason for =
coming into contact with you.
I believe that knowing each other has bound us together with a trust that y=
ou will not betray me nor God.
My name is Mrs Hilda Gabz, married to late Mr Francis Gabz, who worked with=
 an oil company here in Ivory Coast for nine years before he died in Octorb=
er 2005. He died after a fatal accident that could have claimed the lives o=
f the entire family.

Before his death we were married for twenty years with a child. When my lat=
e husband was alive we deposited the sum of USD$8.5 Million (Eight million =
five hundred thousand US Dollars) with one of good banks here in Cote d'Ivo=
ire.
Presently, this money is still in the bank.Recently my Doctor told me that =
I would not last more than the next three months due to my cancer illness.
Though what disturbs me most is my partial stroke. Having known my faith, I=
 decided to donate this fund to charity or better still a God fearing indiv=
idual that will utilize this money according to my instruction.
I want a good person that will use this fund orphanages, research centres a=
nd widows and for propagation of the word of God.
I took this decision knowing that I have a child that will inherit this mon=
ey but my son cannot carry out this work because he is still a kid.
Again i and my late husband decided to leave some amount for our son to hel=
p him make a good living. Our son is 17years old now and is growing up here=
 in Africa, He is still a kid and my husband=D2=91s relatives are envious o=
f us and I don=D2=91t want my family's hard earned money to be misused.
I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribut=
e the money which I have there to charity organization but they refused and=
 kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they =
seem not to be contended with what i have given them.
I don=D2=91t want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly m=
anner, hence comes the reason for taking this decision. I am not afraid of =
death for I believe I will be in the kigdom of God.I will want you to help =
me receive this deposit in your account and distribute it according to the =
instructions i will give you later.
As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the bank. I=
 will also issue you a letter of authority that will empower you as the new=
 beneficiary of this fund.

I want you to always pray for me because the joy of the Lord God is my stre=
ngth.Whoever that wants to serve God must serve him in truth and spirit.
Please always be prayerful all through your life. I will like to have your =
phone number for more information about this.=20
Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated here.
Remain blessed in the Lord.

Mrs. Hilda Gabz
